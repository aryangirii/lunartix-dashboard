## Summary Guidelines for CoT Implementation

### For Location Queries:
- Focus only on the requested feature type
- Use appropriate LULC or infrastructure filters
- Avoid unnecessary parameters like elevation/slope/rainfall

### For Suitability Analysis:
- Include relevant environmental parameters
- Consider crop/activity-specific requirements
- Apply multi-criteria filtering
- Include proximity factors if needed

### For Risk Analysis:
- Focus on hazard-relevant parameters
- Combine multiple risk factors
- Consider vulnerable populations/areas
- Include impact assessment

### For Proximity Analysis:
- Define appropriate buffer distances
- Consider accessibility factors
- Include relevant infrastructure
- Account for barriers/constraints

This enhanced CoT framework ensures that the LLM generates appropriate filters based on the specific query type and user intent, avoiding unnecessary complexity for simple location queries while providing comprehensive analysis for complex suitability and risk assessments.
